# Mobile-App---Black-Jack-Game (still on progress)

Recently, I am now trying to update my previous projects with newy learnt techniques. At the same time, I am interested in developing an mobile application. Hence, I try to combine them together, and create this project.

For this project, I am trying to make some enhancement on the previous experience I learnt from blackjack_telegram-bot (https://github.com/kcwu229/blackjack_telegram-bot), and trying to optimate the interaction on user and the program, and also the visualization as well.


<p>I am using Flutter to built the mobile app.</p>



<p>Also, I use the AI generative tool -- stable difussion, to help create the image for the application, to durther speed up the development cycle.</p>


<p>Here would be the preview of the mobile (still in processing ...)</p>


<p>Welcome to our game</p>


<p>We provide the quick game for black jack and other functions, </p>



<p>like changing clothes of the characters / changing another characters (I would try to provide characters CV part, if the status of progress is under expectation)</p>

Everything is still in developing....  (I will try my best to do it !!!!)
