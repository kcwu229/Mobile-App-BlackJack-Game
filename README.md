<p>Recently, I am now trying to update my previous projects with newy learnt techniques. At the same time, I am interested in developing an mobile application. Hence, I try to combine them together, and create this project.</p>

For this project, I am trying to make some enhancement on the previous experience I learnt from blackjack_telegram-bot (https://github.com/kcwu229/blackjack_telegram-bot), and trying to optimate the interaction on user and the program, and also the visualization as well.

<p>I am using Flutter to built the mobile app.</p>
<p>I use the AI generative tool -- stable difussion, to help create the image for the application, Suno AI to help create the instrumental background music, and Photoshop for some graphical drawing.</p>

<p>To create 2D animation on mainPage, I use the Live 2D to build model and create an animation.</p>

<p>Welcome to the game</p>
